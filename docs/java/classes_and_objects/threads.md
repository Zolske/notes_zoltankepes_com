# Threads
> Threads are parts of a program that run on their own while the rest of the program does something else. This also is called **multitasking** because the program handles more than one task simultaneously.  
Threads are ideal for anything that takes up a lot of processing time and runs continuously.  
By putting a programâ€™s hardest workload into a thread, you free up the rest of the program to handle other things. You also make the program easier for the JVM because the most intensive work is isolated.
