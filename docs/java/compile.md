# Compile
The "Java SE platform" is essentially just a specification and not an implementation.  
In order for programs to be compiled and executed, we need a:  
- specific compiler,  
- a runtime environment and  
- an implementation of the libraries.  

There are different implementations from different manufacturers. If the implementations pass a series of tests called the **T**echnology **C**ompatibility **K**it (**TCK**), they can call themselves "Java SE compatible".
